Carrefour Kenya and are currently undertaking a project that will inform the marketing department on the most relevant marketing strategies that will result in the highest number of sales. As a data analyst i wil divide this project into four parts, explore a recent marketing dataset by performing various unsupervised learning techniques and later providing recommendations based on my findings.
Part 1:Dimension reduction
I have performed dimensionality reduction techniques which are PCA and t-SNE algorithms and use the analysis and provided insights gained.
Part 2: Feature Selection

In this section i have  performed feature selection through the use of the unsupervised learning methods which include filter method and wrapper methods. I then performed  analysis and provided insights on the features that contribute the most information to the dataset.

# PROJECT DESCRIPTION : Part 3
Part 3: Association Rules
In this section in will perform association rules.
Association Rule Mining (also called as Association Rule Learning) is a common technique used to find associations between many variables. I created association rules that have allowed me to identify relationships between variables in the  supermarket dataset. I have then provided insights for my analysis.
